# üéÆ About this project

You know when you are playing a game really cool and you want a friend to play it with you? Here it is.

In this version of NLW, we are going to build an application to find game duos!

To find a duo, the person will create an ad to a game, providing the required info. The ones interested in playing the same game will check the ad details, if it's a duo match, they connect over Discord and start playing together. 

This is an entirely complete application, which includes the development of the server, web and mobile applications.

 ### How to run it?

Clone the repository to your machine.

Enter on server folder:
```bash
$ cd server
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

We need to save the records in the database, so in order to do it correctly, check the .env file wich contains the URL for the database connection. 

```env
$ DATABASE_URL="mysql://my_connection"
```

Change it to the database you want to connect. After that, it's time to run the migration:

```bash
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

If the configuration is ready and connected to the database, let's start the application:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### API routes

Inside root folder, there is a file called `requests.http`. This file contains examples of requests to all API routes, as shown below:

```txt
# List all games
GET http://localhost:3333/games HTTP/1.1

# List all ads
GET http://localhost:3333/ads HTTP/1.1

# List ads for a specific game
GET http://localhost:3333/games/80848e26-164b-4e28-8d01-64028fe5f3d4/ads HTTP/1.1

# Get the discord username for the given ad
GET http://localhost:3333/ads/4524a2eb-61f8-4b76-aa52-524c898a918c/discord HTTP/1.1

# Create an ad
POST http://localhost:3333/games/80848e26-164b-4e28-8d01-64028fe5f3d4/ads HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
	"name": "player00",

 ### How to run it?

Clone the repository to your machine.

Enter on web folder:
```bash
$ cd web
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Let's start the application:

$ npm run dev
```

### Important note

In order to deploy the application without deploying the backend server, [Mirage JS ](https://miragejs.com/) was used to mock the backend API.

If you want to connect to the backend project, comment the call to the function `createFakeAPI` on `App.tsx`.
