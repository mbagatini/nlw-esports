# üíª About this project

You know when you are playing a game really cool and you want a friend to play it with you? Here it is.

In this version of NLW, we are going to build an application to find game duos!

To find a duo, the person will create an ad to a game, providing the required info. The ones interested in playing the same game will check the ad details, if it's a duo match, they connect over Discord and start playing together. 

This is an entirely complete application, which includes the development of the server, web and mobile applications.

 ### How to run it?

Clone the repository to your machine.

Enter on server folder:
```bash
$ cd server
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

We need to save the records in the database, so in order to do it correctly, check the .env file wich contains the URL for the database connection. 

```env
$ DATABASE_URL="mysql://my_connection"
```

Change it to the database you want to connect. After that, it's time to run the migration:

```bash
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

If the configuration is ready and connected to the database, let's start the application:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
